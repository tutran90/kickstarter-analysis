# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project/Purpose
Performing analysis on **"Outcomes based on Launch Date"** for Theaters and **"Outcomes based in Goals"** for Plays in the US.
## Analysis and Challenges 
In order to find the **"Outcomes based on Launch Date for Theaters"**, the main data set on the worksheet labeled ["Kickstarter"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90367435/132954646-93b101f0-d8b1-4905-a249-2270800c6cc9.png) was filtered to only show Theaters in the Parent Category. A new column was created to show only the years the projects were launched. A table was then created using the "pivot table" feature on Excel. Years and outcomes were filtered into the rows, columns, and values. Lastly, a chart was [created](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90367435/132954844-b0441f4e-a5c3-4747-931d-75b01040ce6c.png). To[**"Ouctomes based on Goals"**](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90367435/132954897-c227865f-e122-41c5-bec6-4769adc543b7.png).
### **Challenges**
Challenges that occured during this project include:
1. Selecting rows of data that were note adjacent to each other to create the chart that only showed "Percentage of Outcomes". I first attempted tackling this data by selcting the **select data** however was still not able to select the data that I needed. After searching for [how to select nonadjacent rows](www.google.com) I was able to select the rows I needed.
